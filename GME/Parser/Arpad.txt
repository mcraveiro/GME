
- make sure that the GUID returns a byte array of length 16 in a VARIANT
- get_CreateTime, get_ChangeTime, no final '\n' please
- I need get_Project in IMgaFCO
- What should we do with get_Attributes. I need the registry in each attribute,
  even in those that have not been created (???). Currently I dump only the present
  attributes (get_Attributes). (It seems that it returns the full list, hmmm)
- IMgaConnection::get_ConnPoints is not implemented
- ATTVAL_REFERENCE: I assumed that this corresponds to the get_FCOValue
- ATTVAL_ENUM, ATTVAL_DYNAMIC, what shoud I use, how to store them?
- IMgaAttribute::get_Registry is not implemented
- What to do with the IMgaPart objects
- Could the GetBaseType return the "indirect"-ness in its 3rd argument?
- What about the IMgaReference::get_RefAspect, should I dump it?
- IMgaConnPoint::get_Owner should be IMgaConnection, not IMgaFCO. Or?
  the same for get_References (IMgaReference)
- The get_ID should return an XML id, plase use "id-" (for example) instead of '#'

New points:

- acyclic references, additional logic would be required to parse
- in abort transaction the mga notifies the browser 
  which try to start a new transaction...
