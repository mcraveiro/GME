Release Notes of Release r9.20.1 follow.
----------------------------------------

This is a release containing two redesigned components.

The new Model Browser provides almost the same functionality
as the previous one, but its stability was significantly
improved and the new internal architecture enables us to
enhance this component more easily in the future.

The Attribute Browser is now implemented as a standalone
ActiveX component. It provides a unified interface for
attributes, preferences and properties.

In our previous service release a new component has been added.
It is a plug-in, i.e a paradigm independent component.
It provides comprehensive searching capability.


Release Notes of Release r12.18.1 follow.
-----------------------------------------

New features:

- Model libraries allow the creation and reuse of model
repositories. Any project can serve as a library and can be
attached to other projects. Models in the library can be
subtyped and instantiated in the dependent projects. Any
subsequent changes in the library will propagate to the
projects that use it. This feature required file format
modifications. GME will automatically convert binary
files to the new format (saving the original with the .orig
extension), but it is a relatively slow process. However,
subsequent accesses to the file are as fast as before.

- ODBC backend. In addition to the MS Repository and binary
file backends, now ODBC is also supported.

- Annotations, i.e. textual labels, can be added to models.
Their visibility in different aspects, as well as color,
size, typeface, etc, can be controlled from a dialog box.

- Visual connection preference specification. Autorouter
preferences can now be specified on a per connection basis.
In connection mode, the object the cursor moves over is
highlighted. When the cursor is near one side of the object,
a connection point appears. If it is clicked, the new
connection will stick to the selected side of the object.
This selection can later be overwritten using the registry
editor.

- Constraint manager improvements. The constraint manager has
been reengineered. There are new functions to access
information about connections. There is a dialog box that
gives context information for debugging constraints.

- Extensive tutorial. There is a new extensive end-to-end
tutorial included with this version.


As always, please, export all your projects in XML format using
your current version. Please, uninstall any previous version of
GME before installing the program on your machine.
You will need to parse the paradigm defintion files (*.xmp)
that you are using (File menu New Project command and Add
from File button). After this you will be able to load the
projects by importing the xml files your created with the old
version.

Also, some of the COM interfaces changed. So, recompile all of
your existing interpreters. If you are using BON, then you should
use the CretaNewComponent.exe tool in an empty directory and port
you own interpreter files, so that they comply with the interface
changes.

Note that most of the files in the release are read only. So, for
example, if you try to reregister the meta paradigm using the
xml version of the definition, not the binary (.mta), then it'll
fail, since it will try to overwrite the MetaModeling2000.mta
file. If you want to play with the metamodeling paradigm like
that, make a copy of the directory and change the read only
attributes.

Known issues:

- Every time you have a new version of a paradigm, you can try
to load existing projects in binary (.mga) format. The program
will ask you whether to upgrade to the new paradigm. However,
the upgrade process may fail. If so, export you projects in
xml format with the old paradigm, reregister the new paradigm
version, and import the xml file. The xml import/export utility
is the more robust way model migration is supported. Note that
if you make a paradigm change that invalidates existing models,
the xml import operation will also fail. We are working on a
general solution to the model migration problem.


The previous version (v1.2) added these new features:

- User-defined drawing capability. How GME displays model objects is
now decided by external components called decorators. The previous
appearence of boxes for models and icons for other objects is preserved
as the default visualization (also implemented by decorators included with
the GME release). However, users can write their own decorators.
The only requirement is that decorators have to implement a COM interface that
GME uses when it needs to display the objects. The new UML class diagram
paradigm sample comes with its own decorator that displays classnames,
stereotypes and attributes inside the class icon and resizes it accordingly.
The GME metamodeling paradigm has a similar decorator as well. A
decorator shell is also provided with this release to help you write
your own decorators. Note that connection visualization has not changed
and is not customizable.

- Modeless dockable dialog for attributes and preferences. The attributes
and preferences dialogs have been merged into one tabbed dialog window that
is always visible and dockable to the main window frame. These dialogs also
display the object name. There are multiple ways to select the object whose
attributes and preferences are shown. All the context menus (even from the
browser now) provide access like before. If a new object is inserted,
pasted or dropped, its attributes and preferences will be immediately shown.
Finally, simply selecting an object by clicking on it, has the same effect.
Note that currently the attributes and preferences dialog does not support
multiple object selection.

- Add-on and plug-in support. The add-on mechanism has been updated and
tested. Whenever a data file is loaded, the activated add-ons are also
loaded automatically. Add-ons listen to events; the event set listened to
is specified through the component configurator GUI (ComponentConfig.exe) .
For efficiency reasons, Addons cannot  be Builder Object Network components.
Plug-ins are noew accessible throufg a separate command in the File menu.

- OCL syntax checker add-on for the metamodeling environment. As a sample
add-on, the metamodeling environment now comes with this nice helper
tool. Every time a constraint expression attribute is changed this add-on
is activated. Note that the target paradigm information is not available
to this tool, therefore, it cannot check arguments and parameters, such as
kindname. These can only be checked at constraint evaluation time in your
target environment.

- Toolbar button/interpreter association capability. Interpreters and
plug-ins can now register toolbar icons. An icon is either a resource in
the component itself, or a separate icon file. If a project is loaded, the
 registered toolbar icons of all the active components are displayed in
the toolbar, providing a user friendly way to start components.  The icon
information is stored in the registry under the 'Icon' field in the
components registry node. Its format is either [<modulename>],
<resource key>, or a full pathname of an image file.

- Component interface version checking. Starting with version 1.2, GME
will be very conservative about component interface versions. First, the
components that make up GME must always be present and have identical
component interface version numbers. Components are also expected to be
built against the very same interace as the GME executing them, although
only a warning is displayed when starting incompatible components. There
is no way to change the interface versions of compiled binaries. The only
possible way to update the inteface version number is to recompile the
components against the up-to-date interface files.

- Type inheritance refinements. The previous restriction, that only root
models can be derived from or instantiated, has been relaxed. Now a
model type can be derived or instantiated provided none of its ancestors
or descendants (in the containment hierarchy) have any subtypes or instances.

- Paste Special commands. Objects on the clipboard can now be pasted as
references, subtypes or intances through these commands available through
the regular menu and the context menus. References can also be redirected
using the Redirection Paste command in the context menu. The usual
restrictions still apply, i.e. paradigm violations and other illegal
operations are not allowed. Note that the paste special commands only
work if the source of the clipboard data is the same project open in the
same GME instance.

- Instant connections through context menus. In the regular edit mode
connections can now be made by the Connect command in the context menu.
Selecting this command changes the cursor to the connect cursor. A connection
will be made to the object that is left clicked next. (Or by selecting the
Connect command on the destination object as well.) Note that any other
operation, such as mode change, window change, new object creation, cancels
the connection operation.

- GME icons settings now allow two macros,$PARADIGMDIR and $PROJECTDIR, that
resolve to the directory of the current paradigm definition or project file,
respectively.

- Updated high-level C++ interpreter interface (Builder Object Network or BON
for ahort). BON now uses the IMgaComponentEx COM interface (also new in this
version). The biggest change is that the Invoke function has been replaced by
InvokeEx, which clearly separates the focus object from the selected objects.
(Depending on the invocation method both of these parameters may be empty.)
Components using the old BON will still work, however, upon invocation a
warning is message displayed reminding users to upgrade the component code
to fully comply with the new BON.

- Tutorials. Two short, simple tutorials have been prepared on metamodeling
and metamodel composition.

- A sample UML class diagram drawing paradigm. To illustrate the user-defined
drawing capabilities of this version, we are including this simple
paradigm as an example. Note that no interpreter is included.

- Java high-level interpreter interface (alpha release). We have prepared
this interface that is very similar to the high-level C++ interface, the
Builder Object Network (BON). This is an experimental version, not tested
thoroughly. A fairly severe restriction is that it is based on Visual J++,
because we have used the Java/COM bridge from Microsoft.
