<p>

When you first ran the interpreter of <a href="Lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a> on a
larger model, you probably detected inconsistencies: ports or perimeters not
connected, or connected too many times. It would be advantageous if these
logical errors could be detected as early as possible, preferably at the exact
moment when the user makes the inconsistent modification.
<p>

This lesson introduces <i>multiplicities</i> and <i>constraints</i>,
the GME consistency checking mechanisms.
<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>6.1 Multiplicity</font></u></b>
<p>

Whenever an association is defined in the metamodel, a sequence of
symbols, such as "0..*", appears at both ends. This is the <i>multiplicity</i>
specification, which determines the acceptable number of associations in which an
object can participate. The usual format is <i>&lt;min></i>.. <i>&lt;max></i>
(or <i>&lt;minmax></i> if the two values are the same). "*" means
infinity, so the default value, "0..*" gives practically no limit on the
number of associations.
<p>

Here is an example from the networking paradigm:
<i><font color="#FF0000">
Interfaces should connect to at most one network or perimeter. (Unconnected
interfaces will be allowed, since router ports sometimes remain temporarily or
permanently idle.)
</font></i>
To indicate this in the metamodel, change the destination multiplicity of the
Connection association from "0..*" to "0..1". To achieve this, right click on
the association line on the destination side and change its Cardinality
attribute as described before. <i><font color="#FF0000">Also, make sure that each Perimeter is connected to exactly one Network, or to
another Perimeter.
</font></i>
Set the "dst" multiplicity of the NetworkEquiv association to "1".
<i><font color="#FF0000">
It is useless to allow Perimeters without associated Networks, so 0 is not
permitted in this case.
</font></i>

</center>
<p><br>


On the association line, multiplicities are indicated at the opposite end from
the object to which they apply. For example, in the paragraph above, a
multiplicity rule that applies to interfaces is actually indicated at the
"network" side of the connection.
<p>

Internally, GME treats multiplicities as a special kind of constraint for
which a simple specification mechanism is provided. Generic constraints are
more powerful than multiplicites, but are more difficult to specify. As soon as
a new version of the paradigm is generated, the necessary constraint settings
will automatically take effect. These are "warning" type constraints; they are
not "enforced", but violations are reported to the user in the form of a dialog
box. Adherence to the constraints is checked in response to the following
events:

<ul>
 <li>
  The parent model of the object for which the limited multiplicity is in
  effect (i.e. interfaces and perimeters in our example) is <i>closed</i> in
  the editor or <i>collapsed</i> in the browser.
 <li>
  An interpreter is started and the object for which the multiplicity is in
  effect is visible, either as an open model or as a child of an open model.
</ul>
<p><br>

<br><a name="6.2"></a>
<b><u><font size=+1>6.2 Constraints</font></u></b>
<p>

Multiplicities specify the number of objects that can participate in a particular
association, which is a typical consistency rule. However, there are many other
plausible situations in which more general validity rules need to be expressed.
These rules are provided by a general and functionally rich language,
originally defined as part of the standard UML notation: OCL, the Object
Constraint Language.
<p><br>


<b><u>6.2.1 Object Constraint Language (OCL)</u></b>
<p>

GME includes the full OCL 1.4 with some extensions to the original language.
OCL is based on predicates, sentences that are either true or false and must
evaluate to "true" in order to satisfy the constraint. As an example, study the
following constraint:

<blockquote><tt><b>
self.parts( Fuse )->forAll( b : Fuse | b.amps &lt;= 60 );
</b></tt></blockquote>

This constraint will be satisfied only if all the "Fuse" children of the object
(such as a Fusebox) have an "amps" value not greater than 60. Another
constraint, slightly more complex, requires that at least five red or green
fuses exist in the fusebox:

<blockquote><tt><b>
self.parts( Fuse )->select( b : Fuse | b.color = "red" or b.color = "green" )->size > 5
</b></tt></blockquote>

The examples above illustrate the following principal features of this
language:

<ul>
 <li>
  The OCL syntax seems rather unusual at first, but is actually fairly
  simple. The language uses a number of operators (like "=", "&lt;", and "->")
  and a reasonable set of built-in oprations (like "parts( )",
  "select( )", and "forAll( )"). Most of the extensions in GME are actually used
  to navigate the GME model tree. With moderate practice in understanding
  operators, expressions can easily be read as natural-language predicates or
  sentences.
 <li>
  OCL is purely functional. In other words, the only product of an operation or feature call is
  its return value. There are no variable assigments or other side effects.
  Long expression chains and function call sequences are typical
  characteristics of functional languages.
 <li>
  Expressions at the top level of a statement are always of boolean type, but
  subexpressions can be strings, integers, booleans, FCOs, folders, or
  collections (Sets, Bags, Sequences) of these types.
 <li>
  Feature calls in expression chains are applied to the result of the subexpression
  that precedes the "->" or "." operator. Expressions have an implicit object
  that serves as their context and their default argument. This object is
  always the one that the constraint is attached to (in this case, the
  Fusebox). It serves as the default context of (sub)expressions if nothing
  else is specified. So "<i><tt>self.parts( Fuse )</tt></i>" selects children of the
  current fusebox, but "<i><tt>b.color</tt></i>" specifies another
  object - the one temporarily referred to as "b" - so the current model is not
  used.
</ul>

See Appendix B (the OCL language summary) in the GME Users Manual for
a detailed definition of the GME OCL language.
<p>

There is a simple mechanical way to convert OCL expressions into grammatically
correct natural language predicates, although the resulting sentence may be
rather hard to understand. This is mainly because natural languages do not have
good "bracketing" mechanisms. For example, "<i>this dwarf is sleepy or hungry
and angry</i>" may translate to either <i>"(sleepy or hungry) and angry</i>",
or "<i>sleepy or (hungry and angry)</i>" ). For the same reason, converting
natural language predicates into OCL is not a straightforward task, althought OCL
uses the usual precedence and associativity rules of operators and expressions.

The process of creating a constraint will be illustrated with the networking
example. Let us consider the following problem: The modeling environment
introduced Perimeters to represent "central" or "backbone" Networks in
lower-level diagrams. So far, however, nothing has kept the user of the
modeling environment from connecting a Perimeter to a Network in the same
diagram. This is clearly not what Perimeters should be used for. Let's see if a
constraint will help us solve the problem. The natural language constraint
predicate would look something like this:
<p>

<i>"For all network equivalence relationships, the parent of the source
Perimeter must be a sibling of the destination."</i>
<p>

We can simplify the language by avoiding the use of the "sibling" predicate and
getting rid of some unnecessary information. The result is:
<p>

<i>"For all network equivalence relationships, the parent of the parent of the
source must be equal to the parent of the destination."</i>
<p>

The predicate now contains a very limited set of functions:

<ul>
 <li>
  selection of a group of objects by kind/role
 <li>
  "for all" iterator
 <li>
  accessing the source, destination and parent</li>
 <li>
  comparison of objects
</ul>

Since the OCL reference contains functions for all of these concepts, the first
OCL constraint can be assembled:

<b><tt><blockquote>
<dl>
 <dt>
  self.attachingConnections( EquivalenceConn )->forAll( c |
 <dd>
  c.connectionPoints( "src" )->theOnly().target().parent().parent() =
  <br>c.connectionPoints( "dst" )->theOnly().target().parent()
</dl>
</blockquote></tt></b>

This OCL expression will now be used as a constraint.
<p><br>


<b><u>6.2.3 Designing a constraint</u></b>
<p>

An OCL expression becomes a constraint when it is specified in the metamodel
along with some important additional information.

First of all, we need to choose which metaobject the constraint should be
attached to. Since a constraint usually specifies the configuration of several
objects, this is not always a trivial decision, although the complexity of the
constraint expression often varies depending on the object to which it is
assigned. As a general rule, <i>a constraint should be bound to the object
around which the problem is centered</i>. In the networking example, the
problem focuses on the equivalence connection (NetworkEquiv) itself. From the
perspective of the connection, the OCL expression looks simpler:

<a name="MCLexp"></a>
<blockquote><tt><b>
self.connectionPoints( "src" )->theOnly().target().parent().parent() =
<br>self.connectionPoints( "dst" )->theOnly().target().parent()
</b></tt></blockquote>

The automatic simplifying of the expression is a good indication that our
choice for the attached object is the right one.
<p>

Next, we must determine when a constraint needs to be checked. Optimally,
constraints should be checked on the fly, whenever a possibly relevant change
occurs. Since the constraint translates into a constraint-checking algorithm
which needs to be run in order to do the test, continuous checking is not
possible (or, at the very least, not efficient). Instead, the metamodeler
should specify the particular operations during which this constraint could be
violated. GME classifies all modifying operations into the following
categories.

</table>
</center>
<p><br>


These events can be selected or deselected in the Attributes dialog for
Constraint objects in the metamodeling environment (Fig 6.2).
<p>

According to the list, OBJEVENT_RELATION seems to be the most suitable
operation. This event occurs when a new connection is created, or when an
existing one is modified. (It is also triggered if any of the target objects is
moved in the modeling hierarchy.)
<p>

A third piece of information to specify is the <i>scope</i> (or <i>depth</i>)
of the constraint. Sometimes the event is not generated for the object that the
constraint belongs to, but to a descendant of that object. An example of this
situation is when a constraint is attached to a model, which mandates some
specific attribute configuration for the children of the model (e.g. "order
number is unique for each child"). The events are generated for the children,
while the constraint is associated with the model (it could also be associated
with the children, but that may result in a clumsier constraint expression).
<p>

Depth has 3 possible values:

<ol>
 <li>
  0 - the event must be generated in the the constraint owner in order to check
  the constraint.
 <li>
  1 - the constraint is checked if the event is generated in either the
  constraint owner object or any of its immediate children.
 <li>
  "Any" - the event may be sent to any of the descendants of the constraint
  owner (including itself) for the constraint to be checked.
</ol>

If a constraint is attached to a non-container (anything other than a model or
folder), the depth setting does not matter.
<p>

Our final task is deciding what to do if a constraint check fails. These actions
are specified through <i>constraint priority</i>, which also determines the
order of constraint tests so that grave violations can be dealt with before the
less serious ones. Priorities range from 1 (highest) to 10 (lowest). A priority
of 1 means that the constraint is enforced; if a violation takes place, it must
be dealt with. Lower priorities are given to "informational" constraints, where
the user can ignore the violation if desired.
<p>

Generally, a constraint should be informational if it may produce false alarms,
or if there are certain situations in which the constraint may be legally
violated (for example, a new object with a non-zero multiplicity is created and
is not yet connected to anything). Also, constraints fired at the "close model"
phase should be strictly informational.
<p>

In the networking example, there is no compelling reason to be tolerant;
therefore, the highest priority will be specified.
</ol>
<p><br>


<b><u>6.2.4 Adding a constraint to the metamodel</u></b>
<p>

We now have enough information to be able to add the first constraint to the
networking metamodel (Fig 6.2):

<ol>
 <li>
  Open the metamodel and the ParadigmSheet.
 <li>
  Switch to the "Constraints" aspect, and insert a constraint near the existing
  metaentity named "NetworkEquiv". Associate the two objects by drawing a
  connection between them.
 <li>
  Assign a name to the constraint, something like "EquivPointsToUpperLevel".
  Open the attributes dialog, and enter the OCL expression as seen
  <a href="#MCLexp">above</a>. Click the checkbox for the "On change assoc"
  event, and set Priority to "1". Depth is irrelevant in this case, although 0
  is the logical choice. The description should be something similar to
  "NetworkEquiv relation must point to object at a higher level." (The default
  parameter Attribute is only used for constraint functions, which are not
  covered by this tutorial.)
 <li>
  The metamodel has been successfully updated; interpret and register the new
  paradigm.
</ol>
<p><br>


<center>
<img SRC="L6/F2/Fig6_2.png">
<br><b>Fig 6.2 Specifying a constraint in the <a href="L6/F2/networking.xme"> metamodel</a></b>
</center>
<p><br>


Open a network diagram and update the paradigm, either directly or through XML
export/import. When the File/Register Components... dialog is opened, we see
that the constraint manager has been activated (<b>!</b>). Test the constraint
by attempting to connect Perimeters and Networks in the "right" way and the
"wrong" way. Also, try moving either end of the connection to see if the model
behaves as expected.
<p>

This constraint was the first to be added to the model, but it is certainly not
the only possible one. Challenge yourself by creating extra constraints that
fulfill the following requirements:

<ul>
 <li>
  Every router has at least one Ethernet port.
 <li>
  No two hosts are allowed to have the same IP address.
 <li>
  Every diagram, except the root diagram, must have at least one Perimeter
  object.
</ul>
