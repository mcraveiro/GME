<a href="Lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a> introduced three of the primary modeling 
entities: atoms, models and connections. Obviously these concepts (or 
functionally equivalent ones) are essential for modeling even the simplest 
systems. Their use in more complex systems was demonstrated through the 
hierarchical network modeling application of <a href="Lesson2.html">Lesson 2
</a>.
<p>

Still, there are countless situations that would be cumbersome and/or 
impossible to model using only the concepts seen so far. Fortunately, GME 
supports a few additional concepts that add to its descriptive power, giving it 
a much wider range of modeling capabilities.
<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>4.1. References</font></u></b>
<p>

Consider the following problem in the networking domain.
<p>
 
<i><font color="#FF0000">
We have an ambitious modeling project which describes a complex, hierarchical 
network. The root model is the Internet backbone. The next level contains the 
continents: Europe, North America, Asia, etc. Within each continent there is a 
level consisting of country networks, which have an optional level of domestic 
regions (U.S. states, for example). Under those, each Internet Service Provider 
has a separate NetDiagram, and each ISP client with more than one PC has a 
separate NetDiagram on the lowest level.
<p>

Imagine a situation in which two companies, ZebraStripes PLC (a client of the 
ZimbaNet ISP in Zimbabwe) and PantherSpots Corp. (a client of BurmiNet in 
Burma), recognize that they are doing so much business with each other that the 
added bandwidth of a direct leased line between them would significantly improve 
their synergy. (See Figs 4.1 - 4.3.) A leased-line connection is typically 
configured as an IP network between two router ports with only two addresses 
used at either end of the line.
<p>

Where will this leased-line network be inserted in the hierarchy? How can we 
represent the idea that these companies connect to a network that spans two 
continents?
<p>

If we follow the rules set forth in <a href="Lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a>, our 
solution will be to find the lowest point in the hierarchy where both companies 
are contained, insert the new network there, and use a chain of perimeters along 
the hierarchy levels to make the network accessible in both companies. Since the 
lowest point in this case is "World", the network should be placed there. A 
perimeter is added to each level (continent, country, ISP, company), and the 
perimeters are connected by NetworkEquiv relationships, so that the perimeters 
in both company diagrams are "wired" to the new Network object in "World".
<p>

Clearly, this action will add at least 8 extra Perimeter objects to our model. 
Also, we must put the new Network in the highest level of the hierarchy. As the 
number of leased intercontinental data lines continues to grow, the "World" 
diagram quickly becomes too large to handle. Other plausible scenarios, such as 
ISPs or other distribution centers with data lines to more than one continent or 
country, only exacerbate the problem. These situations are common; many European 
ISPs have their own direct leased-line connection to the U.S.
</font></i>
<p>

Translating all this into modeling terminology, the problem is that we do not 
yet have a way to represent <i>relations that cross hierarchies</i>. 
Connections, our only relation so far, can only connect objects when they are in 
the same NetDiagram or when one of the diagrams is the immediate child of the 
other. <i>References</i> in GME are provided to overcome this exact 
limitation. As the name implies, a reference is an object that represents 
another object somewhere (possibly far away) in the modeling hierarchy. When a 
reference is created, it is associated with a <i>referred object,</i> which it 
represents (unless it is a <i>NULL reference</i>).
<p>

For the networking example, references offer us several solutions for the 
problem described above:

<ol>
 <li>
  Introduce a new type of object, a <i>reference to a NetDiagram</i>. The new 
  NetDiagram typically contains a new Network and references to the local 
  NetDiagrams of the two companies. Both of the company networks have a new 
  Perimeter connected to the ports that their routers use for the new leased 
  line. (Fig 4.1) A reference to a model mirrors and displays the ports of the 
  referred objects, and they can be connected just like the ports of the 
  original models.
</ol>

<br>Solution #1: using NetDiagram references
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="2">
 <li>
  Extend the metamodel with a <i>reference to a Router</i>. Router references 
  allow routers to be "replicated" in remote NetDiagrams and connected to a 
  Network or Perimeter in those diagrams.
  <br>
  Using this solution, we can choose one of two options:

  <ol type="a">
   <li>
    Create a reference to ZebraStripes's router and add it to the NetDiagram of 
    PantherSpots. Also add a new Network (for the leased line) and connect it 
    to both the RouterReference and the router of PantherSpots. (Fig 4.2) This 
    method symbolically "assigns" the leased line to one of the companies.
   <li>
    Create a new NetDiagram. Add a Network and two RouterReferences, one for 
    ZebraStripes' router and one for PantherSpots' router, and connect the 
    selected ports to the network. (Fig 4.3) This emphasizes that the leased 
    line is not under the authority of either company. The new NetDiagram can 
    be inserted anywhere, but the best place is probably in the root folder, 
    outside the Internet hierachy.

<br>Solution #2b: using multiple Router references
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="3">
 <li>
  Introduce <i>references to RouterPorts</i>, i.e. references to atoms. It is a 
  solution similar to the previous techniques using router references, but 
  somewhat less evident.
</ol>

Working with the specific details of this example could cause the MIC amateur 
to "miss the forest for the trees", so to speak, if you feel a bit lost, don't 
worry. Here is a summary of the essential ideas needed to understand 
references:
<p>

Even though hierarchy is a very useful concept, there are situations in which 
it cannot efficiently model a system on its own. Most systems have components 
which cannot be fully isolated within the hierarchical containment. Also, 
sometimes there are a few objects that belong to multiple locations in the 
hierarchy (e.g. a secretary working for two different departments). Therefore, 
techniques are needed to refer to remote objects from within the diagrams. 
<i>References</i> are objects that represent other objects, typically located 
somewhere else in the modeling hierarchy. References provide the ability to 
span the hierarchy without "breaking" it and voiding its convenient properties 
(each object has a single parent, traversing the tree visits each node exactly 
once, etc.).
<p>

References are such powerful tools partly because different modeling
scenarios use references in different ways:

<ul>
 <li>
  A reference may behave like an <i>alias</i>, an object nearly 
  indistinguishable from the referred object itself. The visual appearance of 
  references used as aliases is usually identical to, or very similar to, that 
  of the target object. Obviously, aliases cannot exist without their referred 
  objects, and often aliases are immutable (bound to their target for a 
  lifetime).
 <li>
  At the other extreme, references may be used as pointers. Pointers are 
  clearly separate entities from their targets, and may be reset to other 
  targets during their lifetime. They may even be null-pointers, referring to 
  nothing.
</ul>
<p><br>


<b><u>4.1.1 Defining and working with references</u></b>
<p>

We will now update our networking metamodel so that we can create models with 
Router references, as shown in Fig 4.2 and Fig 4.3. (The same paradigm can be 
used for both models.)

<ol>
 <li>
  Open the metamodel and the ParadigmSheet. Drag a new item, a 
  <b>&lt;&lt;Reference>></b>, onto the Paradigm window. Name it "RouterRef". 
  Connect it to the "Router" <b>&lt;&lt;Model>></b>. Select "ReferTo" from the 
  list that pops up. This type of connection (terminated by an arrow) states 
  that RouterRefs can refer to models of type Router. References can refer to 
  models, atoms, or other references. Also connect the reference to NetDiagram. 
  Select "Containment" as the connection type, because we want to show that 
  RouterRefs can be drawn onto NetDiagrams.
 <li>
  Switch to the Visualization view, and add RouterRef to the Connectivity 
  <b>&lt;&lt;Aspect>></b>. (Otherwise we would not be able to create or view 
  RouterRefs anywhere in the model).
 <li>
  Interpret and register the metamodel.
</ol>
<p><br>


<center>
<img SRC="L4/F4/Fig4_4.png">
<br><b>Fig 4.4 A reference in the <a href="L4/F4/networking.xme"> metamodel</a></b></center>
<p><br>


Now let's build a model with a leased-line connection between two companies, 
using the technique shown in Fig 4.3. 

<ol>
 <li>
  Create a new network diagram using the new paradigm, or open the example from 
  <a href="Lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a>. Insert a new NetDiagram model into the 
  root folder, and name it LeasedLine1. Create a Network inside the new model 
  that will connect the two routers.
 <li>
  To create the references, drag the routers from both companies into the new 
  model, <u>while pressing the Ctrl and Shift keys</u>. You can use both the 
  browser and the model windows as the source and/or the destination of the drag 
  operation; all combinations will work. You can even drag both routers in a 
  single step if you select both in the browser window.
 <li>
  The router ports are visible on the references, but there is a problem: the 
  routers have no free ports to connect to the new network. A port cannot be 
  connected to more than one (outside) object, even if the port's existing 
  connection is not visible in the current diagram. 
  (<a href="Lesson6.html">Lesson 6</a> will introduce <i>constraints,</i> 
  mechanisms designed to actually enforce this rule.) We can fix this by adding 
  new ports (assuming that the real-world routers can be extended). When a 
  reference is double-clicked, it will locate its parent object. Double-click 
  one of the RouterRefs, add a new port (i.e. Perimeter), and name it something 
  like S1 (a typical name for the second serial port of a router). The new port 
  will immediately become visible on the LeasedLine diagram as well. This 
  clearly shows that a reference is not a copy, but a representation of the 
  referred object. Repeat these steps for the other RouterRef. Now you can add 
  connections from the network to the new ports, arriving at the state shown in 
  Fig 4.4.
</ol>

References add a significant amount of power to GME. All real-world GME 
applications use references; some applications use them extensively. Sometimes 
they are used as aliases, sometimes as pointers, and sometimes they simply 
represent a generic association, where the concept of a reference seems to be 
more intuitive than a connection. This is often the case when the real-world 
object is a kind of pointer by itself: a Table of Contents Entry in the model of 
a book, for example, or a mailbox for a recipient in the model of a mail 
forwarding system. When working with GME, feel free to use references for any 
purpose and to define any type of semantics for them.
<p>

Connections and references are two different types of associations in GME. 
But they are often used together, as in the example above: the reference locates 
a remote object so that a connection can be established between two objects 
which are not visible together from any container.
<p>

It is worth noting that many other modeling tools do not have anything 
resembling a reference, which makes the concept even more remarkable.
<p><br>


<hr width="80%">
<br><a name="4.2"></a>
<b><u><font size=+1>4.2 Sets</font></u></b>
<p>

We have already seen two different types of associations in GME: connections 
and references. Together, they have the power to describe any situation. 
Sometimes, though, these associations are not the most convenient option. Let's 
see if we can use them for the following example:
<p>

<i><font color="#FF0000">
Mid-size companies have several IT administrators. Each administrator is usually 
responsible for a couple of machines. Important machines may have several 
administrators (and some of them work for years after the only person with 
administrator access leaves the company...). We want to extend the network model 
to include information on administrators and their responsibilities.
</font></i>
<p>

Let us introduce a new object, "Administrator". How shall we represent the 
"administers/administered by" relationship?

<ul>
 <li>
  References will not work. A reference can only be associated with a single 
  object, while an administrator may be responsible for several machines. A 
  machine may also be administered by several people, so using references 
  in the reverse direction is not feasible either.
 <li>
  Connections may certainly be used. However, every network device will have at 
  least one new connection. Even if a new appearance is assigned to these 
  connection lines, the vast number of new lines would render the diagrams 
  unreadable.
</ul>

<i>Sets</i> are the GME concepts recommended for situations in which an 
object has to be associated with a relatively large number of neighboring 
objects in a diagram. These objects are called the "members" of the set. In many 
cases, the real-world object itself has a natural set-like property: if you hear 
of an administrator, in a networking environment, the first thing you want to 
know about an administrator is the group of machines he is responsible for.
<p>

One way to understand sets is to compare them to the way that aspects are 
specified in the metamodeling environment. In that situation, sets represent 
meta-aspects. The "lasso" selection mode used when dealing with aspects 
( <img SRC="Icons/SetMode.png" align=top> ) also provides a way to specify set 
memberships.
<p>

This example shows that the concept of sets is not as indispensable as that of 
connections or references. Sets can usually be replaced by connections. You 
should regard sets as an alternate association technique that supplies greater 
convenience in many situations.
<p>

(Please note that the current version of GME supports sets in a rather
limited way: the set and its members must be siblings, and objects represented
by references cannot be added to the set. These limitations will be eliminated
in future releases.)
<p><br>


<b><u>4.2.1 Defining and Working with Sets</u></b>
<p>

Let us extend the network modeling environment by adding administrators, as seen 
above.

<ol>
 <li>
  Open the metamodel, and insert a new <b>&lt;&lt;Set>></b> into the paradigm
sheet. Name it "Admin", and specify an icon for it in the attributes dialog
box. Here is how I imagine a friendly administrator:
</ol>
<p><br>


<center>
<table BORDER cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td align=center>
      <a href="Icons/Admin.bmp">
      <img SRC="Icons/Admin.bmp"><p>
      Admin.bmp</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="2">
 <li>
  Administrators can administer any machine; this includes Routers, Hosts, and 
  WSGroups. Connect each of these metaentities to the new set. These are 
  "SetMembership" associations. Also connect the set to NetDiagram with a 
  containment relationship, to indicate that Administrators can be placed inside 
  NetDiagrams. Add the set to the Connectivity aspect in the Visualization view.
 <li>
  The updated metamodel should look like the one shown in Fig 4.6. Interpret and 
  register it.
</ol>
<p><br>


<center>
<img SRC="L4/F6/Fig4_6.png">
<br><b>Fig 4.6 A set in the <a href="L4/F6/networking.xme"> metamodel</a></b>
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="4">
 <li>
  Now experiment with the sets in the modeling environment. Update the example
model to the new paradigm, and add an "Administrator" into a company NetDiagram.
Enter the set mode ( <img SRC="Icons/SetMode.png" align=top> ) and right-click
the set. The set is selected as the "controller" now, so you can add and
remove objects by left-clicking them. Note that only the objects
specified as potential set members in the metamodel can be added to a set.
</ol>
<p><br>

<p><br>


Now that we have completed Lesson 4, all members of the FCO family (models, 
atoms, connections, references, and sets) have been introduced. Additional 
GME concepts will be discussed in future lessons. These concepts are just as 
important to the modeling environment, but are not FCOs.
