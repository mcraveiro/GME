The BON, Builder Object Network, was originally implemented in C++. 
However, some GME users may not be able to program in C++ or might
not have Microsoft's Visual Studio to compile a BON interpreter. Also, 
a particular problem might be easier to solve in Java than in C++. For 
many reasons such as these, a Java COM interface to GME and Java version 
of the BON have been created.

<p>

This lesson discusses the process of building a Java based 
interpreter. The example interpreter will be domain independent. 
The paradigm used to test the interpreter will be that from 
<a href="Lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a>. Our interpreter will simply display 
a message box showing set and reference information from the list of 
currently selected FCOs.

<p>

To use the Java interface to GME, one needs to have the latest version 
of GME installed which includes JAUT.dll and JavaCompRegister.exe in addition 
to having the latest JRE or JDK installed on their machine. The packages 
that will be used are:

<ul>
 <li>
  org.isis.gme.mga
 <li>
  org.isis.gme.meta
 <li>
  org.isis.gme.bon
</ul>
<p>

First create a class that implements either the BONComponent or Component Interfaces in the bon package.
Implementing BONComponent will give access to GME through the BON, whereas implementing 
Component will give access through a Java Raw COM implementation.  
There is a TestBONComponent.java and TestComponent.java included in the bon package as 
examples. This tutorial uses TestBONComponent. Now run JavaCompRegister.exe:

<p><br>


Notice that the ClassPath is the path to the package and the Class entry needs 
the class name including the package it is contained in. After Registering the 
Java Component, it will become available inside GME.

<p>

The class hierarchy for the Java BON replicates the hierarchy for the original C++ BON, 
with the exception that all classnames that are prefixed with a "C" now start with a "J". 
The Java BON also behaves like the original BON by creating Java Objects corresponding 
to the GME objects found within the project being interpreted. The function names have only 
been changed to reflect the Java convention of function names starting with lower case letters. 
The Java BON is instantiated through a class factory that will instantiate user created 
Custom classes. The example interpreter here will not utilize that functionality. Please see 
the Java interpreter included with the SF paradigm to see an example using the JBuilderFactory.
<p>

The example interpreter here implements the BONComponent Interface. Therefore the invokeEx() and 
registerCustomClasses() functions must be implemented. Because the Factory will not be used, the 
registerCustomClasses() functions can be left empty. The invokeEx() function will take the 
selected objects Collection, iterating through it, looking for Sets and References. It will build 
up a message string that will display the names and contents of sets, and the names and objects referred 
to by References. If the Reference is for a Model, it will find out what the ports are connected to 
in the Reference, and in the Model Referred to.
<p>

After writing the code (which can be found in the Java class org.isis.gme.TestBONComponent) 
Run GME, enable the component registered at the beginning of this chapter for a paradigm. 
Notice there is now a Java Coffee cup emblem on a button in the components list. The tooltip 
should read what was entered during the registration step. To run, select some objects and 
click on the Java cup:

So now you are able to interpret your GME projects using Java.
