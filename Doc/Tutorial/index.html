<b><u><font size=+2>Introduction</font></u></b>
</center>
<p>

<b><font size=+2>M</font>odeling</b> is one of the most universal scientific 
description techniques. While it is a rather broadly used and thus ill-defined 
term itself, it generally means describing the world in terms of 
<i>pre-established concepts and rules</i>. These rules and concepts govern the 
description process and also make it concise, since details implied by them can 
be omitted without decreasing clarity.
<p>

Most scientific description techniques like databases, computer programming 
languages, or even formal description methods are based on the modeling 
approach. Still, the most well-known representatives of modeling are graphical 
description systems. These tools enhance the illustrative, easy-to-understand 
nature of charts and diagrams with the precision of modeling concepts and rules. 
Things represented by these models can be as diverse as organizational hierarchy 
charts, genetic maps, and community sewer network diagrams.
<p>

Modeling is not only about description and illustration for human use. Their 
adherence to rules and patterns makes models different from drawings, figures, 
or free format textual descriptions. This not only reduces data size and 
disambiguates interpretation, but also makes the model suitable for automatic 
processing. For example, given an up-to-date company hierarchy chart, ordering 
correct business cards for each employee is a very straightforward process.
<p><br>


<b><font size=+2>M</font></b>odeling has been given a boost by the computer age 
in several ways. First, computer programs can now be used to build models. The 
application is straightforward: convenient graphical interfaces provide drawing 
and visual presentation for models, while the program logic beneath maintains 
and enforces strict compliance with modeling rules.
<p>

Second, computers are also suitable for automatic processing of models, thus 
making maximal use of them. While manual processing is tedious, all kinds of 
information (lists, reports, executable code, documentation, etc.) can be 
extracted and formatted from model data "at the press of a button" once the data 
has been inserted into a computer system.
<p>

Finally, information technology is an application area as well as a provider for 
computer modeling. Designing, building, programming, and configuring computer 
systems are tasks with a level of complexity that has been previously unseen. 
Human limits become obvious, and modeling again proves to be instrumental in 
building reliable systems.
<p>

There are are two tutorials presented here. The first tutorial on modeling and the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) takes 
its application example from the IT domain. Throughout the first tutorial's lessons, a 
design, configuration, and analysis tool for network infrastructures will be 
developed. The first tutorial gives an in depth, detailed perspective on GME and
modeling. For those users that want a quick, simple tutorial to get up and
running with GME in no time at all, there is a second set of tutorial lessons,
much shorter than the first. The second tutorial uses the computer science
concepts of Finite State Machines (FSM), Signal Flow (SF), and Boolean logic
circuits as its application of GME.
<p>

GME can export/import from/to XML. Each figure will have a link to an exported XML file containing the GME project
data used to create that screenshot for users that want to check their own
progress against the author's save files. For more on exporting to XML, see
