This lesson introduces three new concepts that are all found exclusively in 
GME (compared to other modeling tools). They are all used by the modeling 
expert to handle complexities that arise when large-scale, real-world models are 
built. In other words, these features make GME a truly scaleable, 
industry-grade modeling environment.

<b><u><font size=+1>5.1 Aspects</font></u></b>
<p>

It is a natural goal of any modeling project to be able to extend the paradigm 
to add new functionality. However, a model's diagrams may become unacceptably 
complex as a result of such extensions. We need a mechanism to maintain 
readability by segmenting or filtering the diagrams.
<p>

<i><font color="#FF0000">
In the previous lesson, the introduction of administrators to the networking 
paradigm was a good example of the extension of a modeling project. It also 
included the risk of making some diagrams incomprehensible. Wouldn't it be 
helpful if the new, administrative aspect could be separated from the existing 
one?
</font></i>
<p>

<i>Aspects</i> in GME provide a possible solution for this problem. Aspects 
are defined in the metamodel, and are associated with models. Models typically 
have multiple aspects. Each aspect specifies what kinds of child objects are 
visible and editable while the aspect is activated for an open model. 
Furthermore, if a child of a model is opened, the aspect used in the child is 
the same one that is used in the parent. If the child does not have a 
corresponding aspect, <i>aspect mapping rules</i> must be specified in the 
MetaInterpreter.
<p>

Aspects are not completely new to this tutorial, since they have been used 
extensively in the metamodeling environment. ParadigmSheets have four aspects: 
Class Diagram, Visualization, Attributes, and Constraints. Each aspect is used 
to define different things. Of course, each aspect only shows relevant 
information: for example, the Attributes aspect displays classes and 
generalization relationships, but omits containment relationships and 
associations.
<p>

<i><font color="#FF0000">
In the networking example, we have been using only one aspect, Connectivity, 
until now. Let us make NetDiagrams more readable by separating the original 
contents, network connectivity diagrams, from the administrative information 
that was added when Sets were introduced in <a href="Lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a>:
</font></i>

<ol>
 <li>
  Open the metamodel and its ParadigmSheet. Switch to the visualization aspect, 
  and add a new <b>&lt;&lt;Aspect>></b> named "Admin".
 <li>
  This will be the second aspect in NetDiagram so connect the two with a 
  containment relationship.
 <li>
  Now specify the member entities for the aspects. Switch to the set mode 
  ( <img SRC="Icons/SetMode.png" align=top> ) and right-click the "Admin" 
  aspect. The following metaentities need to belong to this aspect: 
  Administrator, Router, Host, and WSGroup. (See Fig 5.1.) After that, switch 
  to (i.e. right-click) the "Connectivity" aspect, and deselect Administrator, 
  since that information is not needed on those diagrams.
</ol>
<p><br>

in it</b>
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="4">
 <li>
  Now run the interpreter. Since NetDiagram models have two aspects a
  question need to be answered: which aspect of the Router model should be
  used in the Admin aspect of the parent model NetDiagram. The answer is given
  automatically by the interpreter (typically shown by the "N/A" value in the 2nd column).
  The Router has only one aspect, so a NetDiagram viewed in its Admin 
  aspect will show its Router child in its "Connectivity" aspect if opened.
  (If the Router had two or more aspects then the user interaction is needed by
  selecting the aspect of the child in the KindAspect column.)
  If this question was answered by the interpreter automatically then why did the dialogue box appear?
  Because you can specify which child may be added or 
  deleted in a specific aspect of NetDiagram. Those children which have the 
  Primary value (the 3rd column) set to "no" may not be added or deleted in 
  the specific aspect of NetDiagram. You could specify that in the Admin
  aspect only Admins can be added or deleted to NetDiagram. The Router, Host and
  WSGroup are readonly. Switch to the "Admin" aspect, locate the NetDiagram:Router,
  NetDiagram:Host and NetDiagram:WSGroup and set their "Primary" value to "no".
  Though the "Admin" is a child of the NetDiagram, and is intended to be part of the
  "Admin" aspect of NetDiagram, it is not shown in the dialogue because the interpreter
  knew that it may be part of only one aspect (is not part of the "Connectivity") 
  so it has to have the Primary value set to "yes".
<br>
  The "Configure Aspect Mapping" dialogue (Fig 5.2) appears only if the interpreter
  can not give automatic answers to the questions which rise as the number of 
  aspects grow. 
  Finish interpreting and registering the metamodel.

<br><b>Fig 5.2 Working with the Aspect Mapping dialog</b>

<p><br>


<ol start="5">
 <li>
  When the test model is opened, we see that Administrators are not visible in 
  the "Connectivity" aspect. So far, so good. Switch to the "Admin" aspect. 
  Every object included in this aspect is visible, but the positions of the 
  icons on the screen are jumbled! This occurs because child-object positions 
  are aspect-specific, and these objects have not yet been assigned a particular 
  position in the new aspect. Don't worry, there is a way to fix this problem. 
  Select "Edit/Sync Aspects..." from the menu or 
  <img SRC="Icons/syncasp.jpg" align=top> icon on the toolbar. 
  A dialog box allows you to set a requirement that the positions of selected 
  objects are synchronized from one Aspect to selected other Aspects. Specify 
  "Connectivity" in the "From" field, "Admin" in the "To:" list, and everything 
  (at least all Hosts, Routers, and WSGroups) in the "Objects to be 
  synchronized:" list. (If you make sure that no object is selected before the 
  dialog is opened, the default settings are usually correct.)
 <li>
  Test the specification that was set in the Aspect Mapping dialog: Open a 
  Router from the Admin aspect of a NetDiagram, and make sure that the Router is 
  using the Connectivity aspect.
</ol>

Note that when working in a particular aspect, you can not see, add, or remove 
objects that do not belong to that aspect (like a Network object in the "Admin" 
aspect - Fig 5.3). You can, however, manipulate any object in the browser 
window; aspects have no effect there.

<b><u><font size=+1>5.2 Folders</font></u></b>
<p>

Folders, like aspects, are not a completely new concept; we have been using one 
since the very beginning of this tutorial. That was the <i>root folder</i>, the 
topmost container of all objects in the modeling hierarchy. This section 
discusses other folders and what they can be used for.
<p>

The top-level structure for most modeling projects does not consist of a single 
object containing others; it involves several objects that are related to, but 
not contained by, each other. For example, a school has classrooms, teachers, 
and students; but only the classrooms are "contained" by the school, while 
teachers and students exist independently (a teacher may work for several 
schools simultaneously). A natural representation of this project may contain 
several <i>root FCOs</i> (FCOs not contained by any upper level model): one for 
the school, and one for each individual associated with it.
<p>

(The difference between a root FCO and the root folder lies in the number of 
objects allowed; there can be multiple root FCOs, as in the example above, but 
only a single root folder.)
<p>

If there are numerous root FCOs, it might be a good idea to organize them 
somehow. For the school model, we could separate schools, teachers and students 
from each other. <i>Folders</i> provide this organization, just like 
directories in a file system. Depending on the specifications in the metamodel, 
folders can contain certain FCOs (including root FCOs, obviously), and a number 
of other folders. They cannot be contained by FCOs, however, because they are 
merely the top-level organizers of a modeling project.
<p>

A significant difference between folders and directory systems is that folders 
are typed, while directories are uniform. In other words, the metamodel 
controls what kind of folders (and how many of them) will be available in the 
modeling project. For example, if a separate folder is desired for each type of 
object - schools, teachers and students - three subfolders must be specified, 
each contained by the root folder with a cardinality of 1. Similarly, the kind 
and number of root FCOs is also specified in the metamodel.
<p>

Please note that even though folders are part of a GME modeling project 
hierarchy, they are not considered modeling objects (FCOs) like atoms, 
references, etc. In good models, folders do not represent any real-world 
objects or containers; they are merely organizers of the different kind of 
things that are represented in a modeling project. Because of this, folders do 
not have attributes or aspects (although they do have constraints).
<p>

The folder structure is usually limited in depth, which means it does not 
contain recursion. However, if a folder specifies itself among its potential 
children, the folder structure becomes recursive and unbounded, just like the 
directory tree of modern file systems.
<p><br>


<b><u>5.2.1 Folder example</u></b>
<p>

Let us see how folders can be used in the networking paradigm. Ever since the 
model LeasedLine1 was introduced, there has been nothing (except the name) that 
distinguishes the Internet from this relatively unimportant leased-line network 
in the root folder. It would be nice if LeasedLine1 and similar private 
networks could be hidden from the casual viewer. Let's create a new folder, 
"PrivateConnections" (Fig 5.4).

<ol>
 <li>
  Open the metamodel and the paradigm sheet. Add a <b>&lt;&lt;Folder>></b> 
  named "PrivateConnections" to the top level of the ParadigmSheet. One of the 
  folder's attributes allows us to specify whether this object may be contained 
  by the root folder; make sure this option is clicked (this is the default 
  setting).
 <li>
  The PrivateConnections folder may contain NetDiagrams, so add a containment 
  relationship between the two.
 <li>
  Folders have no aspects, so the metamodel is ready to be interpreted and 
  registered. (Ideally, we would like to make sure that all leased-line 
  networks are put into the new folder by adding constraints or multiplicities. 
  For example, we could specify that the root folder can only contain one root 
  FCO, and that there must be exactly one PrivateConnections folder. 
  Unfortunately, GME does not currently support Constraints and Multiplicities 
  for the root folder.)
 <li>
  Open the networking model. The only visible difference between this version 
  and the no-folders version is seen in the browser window. Until now, only 
  models could be inserted into the root folder; now we can also add 
  PrivateConnections folders. We can drag/drop or cut/copy/paste objects 
  between the folders as well.
</ol>

<b><u><font size=+1>5.3 Using subtypes and instances</font></u></b>
<p>

<i><font color="#FF0000">
Imagine that a company has several branches, and every branch has an identical 
router (same type, model, etc.). The company IT policy requires maintaining 
uniformity among the routers. Is it possible to express these similarities in a 
model?
</font></i>
<p>

<b><i>Subtypes and instances</i></b> are mechanisms in GME that define 
similarities between objects. They are essentially deep copies of a master 
object, and they do not break the relationship with the master: if the master 
changes in any way (attributes, associations, contained objects, etc.), 
subtypes and instances - also called <i>derived objects</i> - make the same 
changes automatically. Also, the differences between a master and its derived 
object are restricted as follows:

<ul>
 <li>
  Instances must be exact structural copies (i.e. instance models must have the 
  same internal structure as the master). Object positions and associations 
  must also inherit their respective settings in the master. Uniqueness is only 
  allowed for attributes and object names.
 <li>
  Subtypes have less rigid rules; containers that are subtypes may have new 
  objects added to them (but objects derived from the master cannot be 
  deleted). Attributes, relationships (such as the target of a reference), 
  object names, and positions within subtype containers may be changed.
</ul>

There are many interesting applications for derived objects:

<ul>
 <li>
  expressing type-instance relationships among real-world objects
 <li>
  efficiently maintaining an array of similar or identical objects
 <li>
  reusing components as libraries or in some other way
</ul>

Another important feature of derived objects is that they are always available
in GME; they are not controlled by settings in the paradigm. Subtypes and 
instances can be added anywhere that normal objects can, and any object may be 
used as a base for derivation. (Note: some restrictions exist to avoid circular 
dependencies. See the GME users manual for details.)
<p>

We will now use one of the previous test models to create several instances of 
a router.

<ol>
 <li>
  Choose a NetDiagram that contains a Router (e.g. CompanyA in Fig 5.3). This 
  router will be used as the master.
 <li>
  Create a few other empty NetDiagrams and give them unique names (CompanyX, 
  CompanyY, etc.).
 <li>
  Instances are created by <u>dragging an object to another location while 
  pressing Alt</u>. (To create Subtypes, press Alt+Shift.) You can use either 
  the opened NetDiagram models or the browser window as both the source and the 
  destination of the dragging operation. Create instances of the master router 
  in all of the new NetDiagrams.
 <li>
  Objects cannot be added, deleted, or moved in the instance models. However, 
  attributes may be set and object names may be changed. Note that attributes, 
  by default, inherit the settings in the master. You should assign unique 
  values to the IPAddr attributes for each instance.
</ol>

The new routers are exact copies of the parent; however, there are some minor 
differences. Instances are indicated by "I" in the browser and in the header of 
an open model, while subtypes are represented by an &quot;S&quot;. Also, if you select an 
instance in the browser and switch to the "Inheritance" pane, the inheritance 
tree of the selected object is displayed (Fig 5.5).

<a href="L5/F5/mynetwork.xme">model</a></b>
</center>
<p><br>


Instances are not references; they are real objects, deep copies of their 
parents. Hence, ports of the master router and ports of the derived routers are 
entirely separate objects. Each port may have different connections, just like 
independently created objects.
<p>

Now let's see how instances have improved our model. Suppose the company 
decides to update all routers at once: a new serial port is added, and the 
speed of the existing interface is updated to 2 Mbps. All we need to do is add 
the new port to the master router, and the instances immediately inherit it. 
What happens to the "speed" attribute of an existing port when it is updated? 
The change is also propagated to the children, unless the attribute is 
explicitly set in a derived object. Since we have not touched the "Speed" 
attribute in any of the instances, the new setting will be propagated to all of 
them.
<p>

The master object of the inheritance - an existing router from an existing 
branch - was selected rather randomly. It would have been much more elegant to 
store the master in a different location, perhaps in a designated folder. This 
would require changing the paradigm by adding a new folder that is allowed to 
directly contain routers. Instead of doing all that work, we chose to 
demonstrate the spontaneous way of using instances instead, through this 
example.
