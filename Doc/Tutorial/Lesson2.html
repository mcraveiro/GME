The network diagram editor from <a href="Lesson1.html#ready">Lesson 1</a> is a 
valuable tool for modeling a relatively small network, consisting of a couple 
of routers and hosts. But as the number of devices represented in the diagram 
grows larger, the diagram becomes more complex and ultimately loses its 
usability.
<p>

<i><font color="#FF0000">
Fortunately, a network with dozens or even hundreds of devices is usually not 
as homogeneous as a small one. Large networks typically have different 
sections, where machines are related much more closely to each other than to 
the rest of the network. Also, there is a good chance that out of all those 
devices, at least a few will be identical (from a network designer's point of 
view, anyway), such as a group of similar user PCs in a department.
</font></i>
<p>

These observations illustrate two basic ways to conquer complexity. First, 
there exists a type of natural segmentation that enables us to transform a 
single diagram into a <i>hierarchy</i> of subdiagrams with varying detail. 
Second, we can use <i>clustering</i>, or grouping a set of similar objects into 
a single unit.
<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>2.1 Creating a recursive hierarchy</font></u></b>
<p>

<i>Hierarchical decomposition</i> is created by representing the details of a 
system on subdiagrams, and inserting only a single reference to the subdiagrams 
in the diagram on the next higher level. For example, if a company has several 
offices worldwide, each office is represented by an individual subdiagram while 
the higher-level diagram will only contain one object for each office. If the 
organization is very big, several intermediate levels (like regional or 
state-level diagrams) may also be necessary.
<p>

Recursion appears if a type of (sub)diagram can accept a similar diagram of the 
same type. In most situations, this cannot happen; the diagrams, or "container 
units", are usually bound to certain levels of the hierarchy. A state 
headquarter, for example, is almost always supervised by a regional center, and 
not by a branch office or another state headquarter. However, in the less 
traditional and more logical world of engineers and computer experts, recursion 
is a key technique for providing extensibility and simplicity. Even if a 
particular application spans only a few levels, it is useful to design the 
architecture so that it has practically no limits.
<p>

It is easy to construct a hierarchy, but it is not always easy to construct a 
good one. In a good hierarchy, objects are usually related only to objects in 
the same container or in adjacent containers; cross-hierarchy links are rare or 
non-existent. An example of a good hierarchy is a traditional military 
organization, or a giant oak. Networking, on the other hand, displays numerous 
semi-hierarchies.
<i><font color="#FF0000">
Networks tend to have multiple cross connections in order to improve proximity 
and fault-tolerance, but at most locations the "upstream" and "downstream" 
directions can still be easily identified.
</font></i>
<p>

The problem of semi-hierarchies results from relationships; in this case, the 
network connections in the networking domain. <i><font color="#FF0000">Suppose 
we designate a contiguous Ethernet network as a subdiagram. Where should the 
routers of this network be represented: in the subdiagram, in the higher-level 
diagram, or in both of them? In other words, do we want to draw the subnet 
boundaries through routers, networks (subnets), or at the point where these two 
entities meet each other? Where are the externally accessible connection points 
(a.k.a. ports) of the subdiagrams?</font></i>
<p>

This "where-to-cut-it-into-pieces" question is often a major problem in 
creating a hierarchy. A possible heuristic decision could be to place a 
restriction on the points where the inner and the outer worlds meet, requiring 
them to be relatively simple atomic entities. Routers with ports are fairly 
detailed structures in this model. Establishing the boundaries at the networks 
seems to be the best idea. The following rules are therefore established for 
the hierarchical modeling paradigm:

<ul>
 <li>
  All devices (routers, hosts, and other objects that will be introduced later) 
  are assigned to a single diagram only. This is known as their <i>parent 
  diagram</i>, and they are not visible elsewhere (neither "upward" nor 
  "downward" in the hierarchy).
 <li>
  Networks are also assigned to exactly one parent diagram. They are not 
  visible from higher-level diagrams, and - as shown below - they are only 
  indirectly visible from the more detailed subdiagrams.
 <li>
  Subdiagrams will accommodate a new object, a type of network called a 
  "<i>perimeter</i>". A perimeter is the representative of a network located in 
  a higher layer of the diagram hierarchy. Perimeters can connect to other 
  devices in the same subdiagram, but they are also visible from outside. The 
  outer diagram contains the subdiagrams with their perimeters indicated, and 
  there is an association to express the relationship between the perimeters 
  and the networks they represent. In GME, perimeters will be defined as 
  ports of the subdiagram entities, and the association to the corresponding 
  network will be a connection.
 <li>
  In a higher-level diagram (one that contains the parent diagram of the 
  perimeter), the relationship between a network and a perimeter of a 
  subdiagram indicates that the network is not isolated, but is connected to 
  devices on a lower level.
</ul>

How does this translate into a metamodel? Let's start with the metamodel we 
created in <a href="Lesson1.html#1.2">Lesson 1</a>!

<ol>
 <li>
  We already have an entity named NetDiagram. Nothing prevents us from reusing 
  NetDiagrams as the subdiagrams of the hierarchy. We need only to specify that 
  NetDiagrams may contain other NetDiagrams. Connect NetDiagram with itself 
  with a composition relationship (the line with the black diamond). Note that 
  we have just added recursion to the metamodel!
 <li>
  Insert a new <b>&lt;&lt;Atom>></b> entity named "Perimeter". Create another 
  composition relationship indicating that Perimeters are valid children of 
  NetDiagrams. Remember that Perimeters are considered "ports" of NetDiagrams
  (set the role of the containment connection to port). 
  Also, do not forget to add the new entity to the one and only aspect 
  (Connectivity) in the Visualization diagram. Since a Perimeter is always 
  connected to a Network, and effectively "represents" the Network, it does not 
  need attributes of its own.
 <li>
  A perimeter is essentially an extension of a network that "spreads" into a 
  subdiagram. So we will use the following bitmaps. Assign these (or your own) 
  icons to Perimeter through the Attributes dialog:
</ol>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p><br>


<ol start="4">
 <li>
  Perimeters and Networks have several similarities. The most important one, 
  perhaps, is that devices can connect to both of them. Therefore, we shall 
  introduce a common generalization for Perimeters and Networks, named 
  "GenNet". Switch the destination of the Connection relationship from Networks 
  to GenNet. Make GenNet abstract.
 <li>
  We must also create a new connection, "NetworkEquiv", which connects 
  Perimeters either to Networks or to Perimeters (in case the network in the 
  grandparent diagram is already represented by a Perimeter in the parent 
  diagram). GenNet is the destination of the connection, while Perimeter is the 
  source. NetworkEquiv must also be added to the Connectivity aspect in the 
  Visualization diagram, and to the NetDiagram entity.
 <li>
  NetworkEquiv represents a completely different type of connection than the 
  one we have been using until now. The best way to differentiate them is to 
  assign a different appearance to each connection. In the Attribute dialog for 
  the new connection, set Line type to "Dash", and Color to "0x0000FF" (the RGB 
  code for <font color="blue">blue</font>).

<br><b>Fig 2.1 The updated <a href="L2/F1/networking.xme"> metamodel</a></b>
</center>
<p><br>


We are done with the metamodel, so interpret and register it. We can now test the new 
hierarchical modeling environment. The first NetDiagram is on the top level of the 
hierarchy: let's call it "World". Our World consists of the Internet and two 
companies which are connected to it. Now we can either manually create the 
subdiagrams, or we can "borrow" a non-hierarchical diagram, like the one from 
<a href="Lesson1.html#ready">Fig 1.7</a> of Lesson 1. That diagram was at the root 
level, but it can be dragged onto the World diagram to make it a child.
<p>

The two child diagrams, CompanyA and CompanyB, need to have at least one perimeter 
that connects them to the outside world (i.e. the Internet). Internally, these 
perimeters behave just like normal networks; anything can be connected to them. 
CompanyA also has a child diagram of its own to contain all its workstations, so that 
the second-level network diagram is not cluttered by all those PCs. (An alternate 
approach to this problem will be presented in the <a href="#2.2">next section</a>.)
<p>

We are already familiar with the browser window, but it is even more useful now that 
we are working with hierarchical data. The NetDiagram models, when opened, cannot 
display the full hierarchy; they can only show two levels at a time (Fig 2.2). The 
browser window, on the other hand, can display as much (or as little) as we want to 
see.
<p><br>


<center>
<img SRC="L2/F2/Fig2_2.png">

<b><u><font size=+1>2.2 Clustering</font></u></b>
<p>

Servers, routers and other network devices form the backbone of an IT infrastructure. 
In addition to these objects, there are typically several workstations. It is 
important to include the workstations in the diagrams (to be able to calculate 
network traffic, for example). However, these machines are typically not significant 
as individuals, but rather as a group of PCs with a common physical location and 
similar network connectivity. Many infrastructures use dynamic addressing (DHCP), 
which indicates uniformity, since addresses are randomly distributed within a group.
<p>

Using the new hierarchical modeling capabilities, we now have a way to handle this 
complexity: create a subdiagram, create a Host for each workstation, connect them all 
to a perimeter, name the diagram something like "BunchOfOrdinaryPCs", and use them as 
a single unit in the higher-level diagram. This approach (shown in Fig 2.2) is 
feasible, but has several shortcomings:

<ul>
 <li>
  From a higher-level diagram, only the name of the subdiagram indicates that nothing 
"important" (such as network devices or further subnets) exists in this diagram.
 <li>
  The separate PC objects will increase the physical size of the model.
 <li>
  We should (and can) have a better graphical representation of those PCs.
</ul>

If the PCs are nearly identical, it is unnecessary to model each of them 
individually. A single object could represent them all, with attributes for the most 
important features. An example would be "25 PCs, with addresses from the range 
192.168.55.10 to 192.168.55.60, located on the 3rd floor of the Memorial building".
<p>

Let a new <b>&lt;&lt;Atom>></b> entity, "WSGroup", represent a cluster of PCs. It 
will be very similar to Host in the metamodel, except that it has a different icon 
and different attributes:

<ul>
 <li>
  An integer attribute, "Number"
 <li>
  Two string attributes, AddressFirst and AddressLast.
 <li>
  A string attribute, "RoomLocation"
 <li>
  Perhaps an indication of usage: an <b>&lt;&lt;EnumAttr>></b> "Workload" with the 
options "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy"
 <li>
  A customized icon:
</ul>
<p><br>


<center>
<table BORDER cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td align=center>
      <a href="Icons/WSGroup.bmp">
      <img SRC="Icons/WSGroup.bmp"><p>
      WSGroup.bmp</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p><br>


There is one more thing to consider about WSGroup. Host implements NetInterface; can 
we do the same with WSGroup? Fortunately, NetInterface does not have any attributes 
of its own (those were attached directly to Host and Port). There is, however, a 
slight semantic confusion about NetInterface; so far, it has always represented a 
single network interface, but we have not really relied on that representation yet. 
Let us redefine (or clarify) the semantics of NetInterface. We now define it to be 
"one or several interfaces connecting to the same network". The definition of 
NetInterface has been loose enough so far to allow this change. Now, having tweaked 
the rules to our advantage, we can make WSGroup a descendant of NetInterface.
<p>

We have saved ourselves a lot of extra work, since Connections will now provide 
connectivity for WSGroups as well. Be sure to indicate that WSGroups are contained by 
NetDiagrams (and do not forget to include WSGroup in the Connectivity aspect).
<p>

Interpret and register the metamodel, and update the networking project through XML. 
We can now add WSGroups to the diagram. Fig 2.3 shows an example of a small company 
network with a few servers, two workstation groups, and Internet connectivity.
