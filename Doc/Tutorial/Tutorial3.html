<h1>Concepts</h1>

<p><i>In this section, the type inheritance concepts in GME
are introduced.</i></p>

<h1>How to use type inheritance in GME</h1>

<p><i>Type inheritance</i> is a feature supported by all
domain-specific languages in GME. We illustrate these concepts using a
circuit-modeling environment.</p>

<h2>Creating the paradigm</h2>

<p>Let’s see the metamodel of digital circuits! All digital
circuits can be built using AND and NOT gates exclusively, so we shall define a
modeling environment with only these two types of gates.</p>

<p align=center><img width=391 height=283
src="./T3/Figure1.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 1:
Metamodel of a Circuit paradigm</p>

<p>In our metamodel, there will be a model class called Circuit containing gates and/or other
circuits. The NOT gates are inherited from the GATE class (see Tutorial 2 for reference on
inheritance operation), as they act almost the same, inasmuch as they have the
same attributes, connections, etc., although the logic they implement differs.
Make the Abstract attribute of the GATE class “true” to specify it to be an
abstract base class, i.e. there won’t be any pure GATE
objects in the target paradigm.</p>

<p>Circuits have
input and output ports (IO). To make IO ports appear as GME ports in Circuit models left click on the containment
connection between the GATE atom and the Circuit model and set the “Object is a port?” attribute to “true”.</p>

<p>Gates can be connected together by wires (LINK). Since AND
gates and NOT gates are derived from the
GATE common base class, it is enough to add
only the GATE class to the Circuit model explicitly using a Composition
connection.</p>

<p>The IO ports can be
connected together by port connections (port_IO).
Actually, we need this connection only when we connect an input or output port
directly to a Circuit port. The
class diagram of this metamodel is shown in Figure
1 above.</p>

<p>We need only one <i>aspect</i>. Again, you do not need to
add AND and NOT
gates to the aspect. They can be added implicitly through the GATE object.</p>

<p>You can define your own <i>icon files</i> for models, too,
by setting the Icon name and Port icon name<i> </i>attributes of the
classes in the Attributes window. It makes sense to define your own icon path
by invoking <i>File/Settings…</i>in the target environment and giving only the
file name and its extension in the Attributes window in the metamodels.</p>

<p>We need an attribute to specify the number of input
connections of logic gates. So add a Multiplicity
attribute to your GATE object in <i>Attributes</i>
aspect. Make it a field attribute of integer type and specify 2 as its default value. Notice, that both
the AND and the NOT
gates inherit this attribute.</p>

<h2>Using the constraint manager</h2>

<p>At model creation time we should check whether the user is
about to create a connection violating one of our restrictions. We can do this
with the help of the <i>constraint manager</i>.</p>

<p align=center><img width=172 height=142
src="./T3/Figure2.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 2:
Assigning constraint objects to gates</p>

<p>Our basic concept was to create the paradigm of AND gates with two, and NOT gates with one input. We do not want to
let the user to create more connections than the gates can accept. Therefore
when the user violates one of our constraints, we would like to send her an
error message, and abort the current transaction. Accordingly we define two
constraints. One constraint limits the number of connections to the maximum
number of ports. The other makes sure the user modifies the Multiplicity attribute of NOT gates to 1.</p>

<p><i>Switch to the Constraint aspect</i> and drag two
constraint objects ( <img width=18 height=18
src="./T3/constraint.gif">) onto your sheet. We would like to check the
number of input connections of the gates each time the user creates a new
connection. To achieve that, <i>connect </i>one<i> constraint object </i>to the
GATE object and <i>name it</i> CheckConn.</p>

<p>Another constraint will check whether the user corrects the
multiplicity attribute of NOT gates. Connect
a new constraint object to the NOT gate
and name it CheckAttr. The result should
look like in Figure 2 above.</p>

<p>The attributes of our constraint objects can be set up in
the Attribute window of them (see Figure
3). In this window you can specify an error message by
typing it in the <i>Description</i> textbox.</p>

<p align=center><img width=516 height=375
src="./T3/Figure3.jpg"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 3:
Attribute settings for CheckConn constraint</p>

<p>We would like to be notified about a validation error of CheckConn constraint just when we try to
create the connection in the target environment, so in the Attributes window of
the constraint set the “On
Connect” attribute to “true”
Here you can select which event or events should activate the constraint
violation checking. In case of the CheckAttr
constraint, the checking should be done when changing the Multiplicity attribute, so set the “On change” attribute to “true”.</p>

<p>Set the<i> Priority attribute</i> of the CheckConn constraint to 1, which will
prevent the current transaction from being committed. You can set the priority
in a 1-10 range, where the highest priority is 1. If you set a lower than 1
priority, the user can decide, whether she still wants to commit her
transaction. For the CheckAttr
constraint set the priority to 2.</p>

<p>The <i>Depth attribute</i> says how deep in the hierarchy
should the constraint be evaluated (0 – only when the object associated with
the constraint gets the specified event, 1 – it is valid for the children of
our object, too, any – all the way down the hierarchy). Set the Depth attribute of the constraints to 0.</p>

<p>We can define the actual constraint expression in the Constraint equation textbox. Here you can
add an OCL (Object Constraint Language) expression. You can see the detailed
syntax in the GME User’s Manual.</p>

<p>Our simple equation for CheckConn
constraint is as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>self.attachingConnections(&quot;dst&quot;)-&gt;size
&lt;= self.Multiplicity</p>

<p>self refers to the
object associated with our constraint object. We execute the attachingConnections() operation on this referred
object to retrieve its connections created to or from this object. The “dst” is the parameter selects only the
collection of the incoming connections. The size
tells us the number of elements in this collection. We can query the
value of the Multiplicity attribute of the object associated with our
constraint object. This will serve as the upper bound for our connections.
Enter the constraint in the Constraint
equation textbox of the CheckConn
constraint. (See Figure 3.)</p>

<p>The CheckAttr
constraint determines the value of Multiplicity
in case of a NOT gate. The equation for
this constraint is:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>self.Multiplicity = 1</p>

<p>Type this equation in the textbox. Whenever a syntax error
is found in the constraint expression leaving the Constraint
equation box, the syntax checker notifies the user about it.</p>

<p>Interpret the Circuit metamodel (<a href="T3/t3Circuit.xme">t3Circuit.xme</a>)
and register the paradigm.</p>

<h2>Using the paradigm</h2>

<p>Let’s design an OR gate
using this paradigm! The logical OR
operation results false if and only if both (all) of its input signals are
false. It is equivalent to the inverse of a logical AND operation with the inverse input signals. Insert a new
paradigm sheet into your root folder and name it OR.
The model of this circuitry is shown in Figure
4.</p>

<p align=center><img width=253 height=95
src="./T3/Figure4.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 4:
Designing an OR gate using the Circuit
paradigm</p>

<p>Notice that the AND gate
has 2 inputs in the figure. If you try to create another link to the AND gate, you will get the following error
message (See Figure 5):</p>

<p align=center><img width=468 height=146
src="./T3/Figure5.jpg"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 5:
Error message because of constraint violation</p>

<p>Your only choice is the Abort option. If you set a lower
priority for the constraint in the metamodel (like you did it for the CheckAttr constraint), you can choose the
other option (Close) and commit the transaction anyway.</p>

<p>If you try to change the Multiplicity
attribute of the NOT gate, and the
value you set, differs from 1, you get the error message you specified for the CheckAttr constraint.</p>

<p>If you change the multiplicity attribute of the AND gate to 4, or that of the NOT gate to 1, you will not get any of these
messages.</p>

<p>In the Attributes window you see every attribute in either
black or gray color. If you modify the value of an attribute, the color is changed
to black. The color tells you whether the attribute value is inherited – gray
(in this case from the metamodel) or is redefined in this object - black. E.g.
if you use type inheritance (see next section), the derived model inherits its
attributes from its base model type as long as you do not change it in the
derived model. Pressing the CTRL-D on the attribute sets back the value
specified in the base type. The same rules apply to the Preferences window.</p>

<p>After creating the model of the OR
gate, you will see a model entry in the browser window that has a capital T
before its name. This shows you that you have a new model type in your project.</p>

<h2>Using type inheritance in GME</h2>

<p>In GME a subtype of a model type can be created by
dragging and dropping the type in the browser or an editing window while
pressing the ALT+SHIFT key combination. An instance is created in a similar
manner, but only the ALT key needs to be held down.</p>

<p>In our example, let’s assume, that we need an XOR gate, too. The result of an XOR gate is true, if and only if exactly one
of the (two) input signals is true. Having two input signals we have two cases:
whether A is true AND B is NOT true OR A is NOT true AND B is true. In addition
to the built-in concepts (AND, NOT) we will need to use an instance of the OR
model type. Insert a new circuit sheet into your root folder and name it XOR. Drag the OR
model type while holding the ALT key and drop it above the name of the XOR paradigm sheet in your Browser window.
Now you can specify the rest of your own XOR
gate model type as shown in Figure
6.</p>

<p align=center><img width=364 height=134
src="./T3/Figure6.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 6:
Designing XOR with type inheritance</p>

<p>We know now how to modify the icon attribute of an object,
so you can change the inherited circuit.bmp entry
in the OR base model type to or.bmp. It makes sense to make this
modification in the OR base model type
so that it will propagate down to all of its subtypes and instances.</p>

<p>Now, we have seen a good application of model instances. Now
let’s see how subtyping can be used!</p>

<p>After modifying the multiplicity attribute of the AND gate we are able to create an OR gate model type accepting 4 input
signals, too. The functionality of this gate, however, is the same as by two
input signals: the result should be false, if and only if all of the input
signals are false. This time you need a <i>subtype</i> of OR model type, so drag it an drop it in your
root folder in the Browser window while pressing the ALT+SHIFT key combination.</p>

<p>In the Browser window you will not see big difference
between the two OR models, but
when you open any of them, should it be the subtype of your model, you will see
the <img width=19 height=16
src="./T3/type.jpg"> button in your Toolbar enabled. Should it be
an instance, the <img width=17 height=17
src="./T3/inheritence.jpg"> button would be enabled. Pressing these
buttons brings you up one level in your inheritance hierarchy. You can see the
type inheritance hierarchy if you switch from the default Aggregation TAB to
the Inheritance TAB in the Browser window while one of the involved models is
selected (See Figure 7).</p>

<p align=center><img width=147 height=170
src="./T3/Figure7.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 7:
Inheritance TAB in the Browser window</p>

<p>Open your new subtype and design it by adding two more input
signals just like you did when you needed the first two of them. To make it
more informative, rename your model subtype OR_4Inputs
by right clicking anywhere in your sheet in the user area or on its name in the
Browser window and invoking <i>Properties</i> in the popup menu. Your subtype
should be similar to that in Figure
8.</p>

<p align=center><img width=344 height=180
src="./T3/Figure8.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 8:
OR gate with 4 input signals</p>

<p>Let’s make some experiments with our model! Open the OR base type to change the name of A input
signal to Q. You can see the propagation process of this modification down to OR_4Inputs subtype and OR instance: the A input signal will be
automatically renamed to Q.</p>

<p>Open the OR_4Inputs
subtype and change this name attribute of Q input signal to In1 breaking the
dependency chain: whenever a modification is made to the name of the Q input
signal in the OR base type, it
will not be propagated down to the In1 input signal in OR_4Inputs (and its existing descendants or descendants to
come), which would be the case, when one modifies In1 in OR_4Inputs, however. That is what you see,
when you try to rename Q in the base type to A again. In the OR instance the modification is made, but
not in the OR_4nputs subtype.</p>

<p>In this situation any other modifications (other property
changes, new part additions, etc.), however, are propagated down to the OR_4Inputs subtype and the OR instance as well.. You can see the
dependency chain of our models in Figure
9.</p>

<p align=center><img width=375 height=166
src="./T3/Figure9.gif"></p>

<p align=center>Figure 9:
Dependency chain</p>

<p>So, we have created an OR
base type and an instance of this base type, which we built in the new XOR base type. Next we derived a subtype
named OR_4Inputs from the OR base type, in which we changed the number of the input
signals the original gate model accepted. The simple type inheritance hierarchy
of our models is depicted on <Figure
10.</p>
