<h1>
Composing metamodels</h1>
<i>First, we shall build the metamodel for a signal flow paradigm. Then
you will need the metamodel of the finite state machine paradigm created
in Tutorial 1 (</i>FSM-Meta.mga<i>). Using these two metamodels we shall
compose a metamodel specifying a new modeling paradigm.</i>
<h1>
Prepare the component metamodels</h1>
Recall the steps of creating the metamodel of the finite state machine
paradigm (See Tutorial 1). These steps will not be discussed afresh. We
shall only explain the metamodel creation of the signal flow paradigm.
<h2>
Create the metamodel of the signal flow paradigm</h2>
The simplest part of our signal flow metamodel is the signal itself. Signals
could be input or output signals but most of their properties are the same.
The common method to capture this perception in our metamodel is to derive
both the input and the output signal atoms from a base signal atom. We
use the “Inheritance” operator (<img SRC="T2/inheritance.gif" height=16 width=16>)
for this. Note: It isn’t the same how you create the connections between
the inheritance operator and the related objects. The best way to avoid
mistakes is to keep a top-down direction: (1) first, connect the base class
to the inheritance operator, (2) then connect the inheritance operator
to one of the objects to be derived. Repeat the second step until you connected
each derived object as desired. You may want to specify your Signal atom
as an “Abstract” class (right click the Signal atom, select Attributes then 
set the ”Abstract?” attribute to true in the Attribute Panel), since 
you only want to create input signals and/or output signals. We only needed the 
Signal atom as common base class. You can see the result in Figure 1.

<p>Figure 1: Inheritance</center>

<p>Signals can be connected to form the signal flow. We need a connection
object (Dataflow) and a connector to describe the relationship of these
objects. Both input signals and output signals can be connected together,
so it is convenient to make this relationship at the base signal object
(See Figure 2).
<center>
<p><img SRC="T2/Figure2.jpg" height=153 width=253>
<p>Figure 2: Dataflow</center>

<p>The signal atom and dataflow connection are both parts of a processing
environment. Furthermore, Signal atom will act as a port of the Processing
model. In our model, we have primitive processes and compound processes.
Primitive processes are the leaf nodes in the signal flow hierarchy that
implement elementary computations in the graph. Compound processes can
contain signals, primitives and/or other compound processes. While assigning
the signal atom and dataflow connection to models, we should keep these
rules in mind. Again, Processing model will be an abstract model, since
we only want to instantiate Primitive and Compound processes in our signal
flow model.
<center>

<p>Figure 3: Class diagram of signal flow model</center>

<p>To make Signal atoms appear as GME ports in Processing models left click
on the containment connection between the Signal atom and the Processing
model and make the “Object is a port?” attribute in the Attribute Panel
“true”. Make sure the Attribute Panel shows the attribute settings for
the containment you meant to. We did not give a special name to this connection,
so you should see the default name “Containment” in the Attribute Panel
indicating the active object with the revealed settings.
<p>Set the “In root folder?” attribute for the Compound model. See Figure
3 for our final metamodel of the signal flow paradigm.
<p>We need to define an attribute of the Primitive class. Following the
steps in Tutorial 1, switch to Attribute aspect and add a field attribute
to the Primitive class. We can name it “CScript”. In the signal flow models
this attribute will contain the C function that implements the functionality
of the given Primitive.
<h2>
Interpret the signal flow metamodel</h2>
This goes just like in Tutorial 1. Do not forget to specify an aspect for
your metamodel. This time you need to assign it to the Processing model
so that you have all your objects in it. Defining it to any other model
objects of your metamodel will cause a warning signal interpreting your
metamodel indicating that not all of your objects are assigned to an aspect.
Save your metamodel as SF-Meta.mga.
<h2>
Export metamodels to XML format</h2>
GME provides a bi-directional XML access for both model and metamodel information.
You can generate XML format of your metamodel by invoking <i>File/Export
XML</i>. Please, export both your finite state machine (<a href="T1/t1s6.xme">t1s6.xme</a>)
and signal flow (<a href="T2/t2SF.xme">t2SF.xme</a>) metamodels to XML format.
<h1>
Composition of two existing metamodels</h1>
In this section, we shall use the two exported metamodels to create a metamodel
of a more complex signal flow paradigm.
<h2>
Load the existing metamodels</h2>
First, following the steps in Tutorial 1, create a new project in GME.
Invoke <i>File/Import XML</i> and select your XML file for the finite state
machine. Press Open. Do the same steps to import your exported signal flow
metamodel !
<h2>
Create the composite metamodel</h2>
We would like to have a new kind of signal flow process that can contain
a finite state machine specifying its implementation as opposed to the
current Primitive that has the “CScript” attribute specifying its implementation.
However, we do not want a regular state machine (i.e. State) to be able
to contain this new kind of model. In other words, we cannot use the State
model as a base class of this new model using regular inheritance.
<p>In GME new inheritance operators were also introduced to provide finer
control over inheritance. When the new class needs to be able to play the
role of the base class, but its internals need not to be inherited, we
use interface inheritance. In this case, all associations and those compositions
where the base class plays the role of the contained object are inherited.
On the other hand, when only the internals of a class are needed by a subclass,
we use implementation inheritance. In this case, all the attributes and
those compositions where the base class plays the role of the container
are inherited. Notice that the union of these two new operators is the
standard UML inheritance.
<p>Following the steps in Tutorial 1, insert a new paradigm sheet into
the root folder. In this case we need to define a new class (FSMNode) that
inherits from both Primitive and State. Inheriting from State through standard
UML inheritance would mean that a State could contain this new type of
node violating one of our objectives. Instead, we use implementation inheritance,
which means, FSMNode can contain whatever a State can, but it cannot act
as a State. Hence, it cannot be inserted into a State. Neither can FSMNodes
be connected together by Transitions.
<p>Let’s create the class diagram! For Primitive and State we can use proxies,
i.e. references pointing to classes defined elsewhere in our metamodel.
To define a proxy, drop a proxy class onto your sheet. Note that we need
<i>model
proxies</i> for Primitive and State. At this point these references (i.e.
the proxies) do not refer to anything. To make them refer to a specific
class, open the proper paradigm sheet you imported and drag and drop one
of the above-mentioned classes onto your proxy. Even if you have created
the reference properly, you will not see any actions confirming your steps,
but if you right click on your proxy object and select the Properties option
you will see in the Refers list box the reference you have created. (Or
you can use the tooltip feature: move your mouse over the proxy and wait
until a yellow label pops up.)
<p>You can see this part of the class diagram in Figure 4.

<p>Figure 4: Implementation inheritance in FSMNode</center>

<p>Next, we want to make the input signals and output signals of the FSMNode
process to be mapped to certain States it contains using connections. To
achieve this, we introduce a new type of connection (SignalMap) connecting
States and Signals together. This connection will be contained in the new
FSMNode class only. To make this connection bi-directional – as desired
– clear the default rolename (“src” and “dst” respectively) in the Attributes
window of both connections drawn to the connector object.
<p>For the Signal we can use an <i>atom proxy</i>. An alternative way of
creating a proxy (reference) in GME is dragging your class from its definition
window and dropping it onto your new paradigm sheet while holding down
the CTRL and the SHIFT keys.
<p>Figure 5. shows the final composed metamodel with new SignalMap connection.

<h2>
Define the aspects for your composite metamodel</h2>
Switch to the Visualization aspect of your metamodel. You can define an
aspect to the new metamodel by using the aspects of the imported paradigms.
You need to create a new aspect and two aspect proxies referring to the
aspects of the imported paradigms. The equivalence operator can define
the relationship of these aspects. Drag two SameAspect objects onto your
sheet. Place one between the two aspect proxies and one between the new
aspect and an aspect proxy. To make sure that the new aspect is called
Composite, name the SameAspect object between the SignalFlow aspect proxy
and the FSM aspect proxy “Composite”. Your aspect definition is shown in
Figure 6. You can find more about aspect equivalence in GME User’s Manual.

<p>Figure 6: Aspect of the composite metamodel</center>

<p>Switch to Set Mode and right click the new Composite aspect. The only
class you have to assign to this aspect by left clicking on it is the SignalMap
connection.
<p>To be able to use a composite signal flow paradigm (<a href="T2/t2Hybrid.xme">t2Hybrid.xme</a>), create it first
by interpreting your metamodel. After you have it successfully interpreted,
register your new paradigm.
<h1>
Use the composite paradigm to create domain-specific models</h1>
We demonstrate how to apply the created paradigm through a simplified model
of a washing machine. Following the steps in Tutorial 1, close your previous
project and create a new one based on the new hybrid signal flow – finite
state machine paradigm. In the Browser window, right click to <i>insert
a Compound model into your root folder</i>.
<p>Now you can create a composite signal flow. A simplified model describing
a washing machine is shown in Figure 7. The white colored Control System
is an FSMNode , the light green (light gray) Logics are Primitives, and
the whole system is in a Compound process. The Control System is described
by a state machine. (See Figure 8.) The dark green (dark gray) colored
boxes stand for States.

<p>You can define your own <i>icon files</i> for objects by setting the
Icon name and Port icon name attributes of the classes in the Attributes
window. It makes sense to define your own icon path by invoking <i>File/Settings…</i>in
the target environment and giving only the file name and its extension
in the Attributes window in the metamodels. The difference between Primitive
models, Compound process models and FSMNode models can simply be indicated
by defining different colors for different model classes, too. You can
change the color of the model boxes in the Preferences window by setting
the Color property.
