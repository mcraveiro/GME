Multi user GME features
-----------------------

1. Creating a multiuser project

  - Start GME

  - File/New Project, select paradigm

  - When it asks for the backend select "Create multi user project"

  - Fill the project location and project name fields. GME will create a new folder named the 
    same as the Project Name under the Project Location.

  - Select source control. If "None" is selected gme will store the project in xml files but files
    won't be under source control.

  - In case of sourcesafe fill the SoruceSafe Database and SourceSafe Project fields. In the 
    SourceSafe Database field the full path of the srcsafe.ini file must be specified. 
    SourceSafe Database must be a network path (!) otherwise other clients won't find the database. 
    In the SourceSafe Project a parent project must be specified, the new project will be created 
    under that with the given Project Name. Sourcsafe project paths always begins with $. 
    Eg.: $/projects or $/

    Example: 
	Project Location   : c:\projects\gmetest
	Project Name       : test1
	SourceSafe Database: \\user1\GMEXMLBackEndTest\sorucesafedb\srcsafe.ini
	SourceSafe Project : $/

    GME will ask for sourcesafe user and password to log in the user to sourcesafe database.

  - In case of ClearCase the project location must be a clearcase controlled dynamic view drive.
    All user have to use the same dynamic view.

  - to import an existing GME project the project should be exported to XML than imported back to
    a newly created multi user project.

  We are done, the multi user project is created and controlled via source control.

2. Joining a multisuer project

  - In case of sourcesafe the user have to get the project files form the sourcesafe using the 
    sourcesafe clinet progam. It have to be done only once after that gme will handel sourcesafe.

  - In case of clearcase the user only need to open the project from the dynamic view drive.

3. Opening a multiuser project

   - Start GME

   - File/Open Project/Open multi user project

   - Select the folder which contains the project

   - If the project is under sourcesafe GME will asks for user name and password to login the
     source control database

4. Saving project

   - After the project is saved, files will be checked in and the user will be asked for keeping files 
     checked out or not. This way the user can keep the files checked out so others won't be allowed 
     to edit or the user can check modifications in giving permission other to edit them.

5. Viewing/Editing multiuser projects

   Once a multi user project is opened GME can be used as usual with the following exceptions:

   - If a modification being made GME tries to check out the necessary xml files form sourcesafe.
     If it can check out all the necessary files the operation will be done. If one or more files
     are checked out by other users GME will roll back the operation and notify the user.

   - When the project is closed GME saves the project see 4.
